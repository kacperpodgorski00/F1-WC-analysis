# Unveiling the World of Formula 1 Through Numbers [Project in progress]

This project is a result of my passion for data analysis and fascination with the world of Formula 1 and is still being developed. For now only some aspects of this prestigious sport are encompassed - race results, driver data and teams. Dataset comes from Kaggle platform.

## Project Goals:

The objective of this project was to conduct a comprehensive analysis of Formula 1 data to identify trends, patterns, and intriguing insights related to the history of this sport. It also aimed to utilize Python programming skills and data analysis tools to create a comprehensive visual and cognitive analysis.

## Project Phases:

1. Driver and Team Analysis: I focused on analyzing the achievements of drivers and teams to identify dominant figures and brands in different periods.

2. Data Visualization: I created some data visualizations that aided in a better understanding of the presented information.
